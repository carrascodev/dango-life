# Dango Life Project
Dango life is a simple farming game with the purpose to learn how to make a game in the GBA platform using C++ and the [butano engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano). The game is being developed by me and the community of my [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/carrascodev), where I stream the development of the game.
